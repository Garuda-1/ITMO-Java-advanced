Henry Ford (July 30, 1863 â€“ April 7, 1947) was an
American industrialist and business magnate, founder of
the Ford Motor Company and chief developer of the
assembly line technique of mass production. By creating
the first automobile that middle-class Americans could
afford, he converted the automobile from an expensive
curiosity into an accessible conveyance that would
profoundly impact the landscape of the 20th century.
His introduction of the Model T automobile
revolutionized transportation and American industry. As
the owner of the Ford Motor Company, he became one of
the richest and best-known people in the world. He is
credited with "Fordism": mass production of inexpensive
goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford had a
global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His
intense commitment to systematically lowering costs
resulted in many technical and business innovations,
including a franchise system that put dealerships
throughout most of North America and in major cities on
six continents. Ford left most of his vast wealth to the
Ford Foundation and arranged for his family to control
the company permanently.
Ford was also widely known for his pacifism during the
first years of World War I, and for promoting antisemitic
content, including The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,
through his newspaper The Dearborn Independent and
the book The International Jew, having an alleged
influence on the development of Nazism.
